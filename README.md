# 🐱 Cat Breed Detector using EfficientNetV2-S

An interactive **cat breed classification web application** built with **Streamlit** and powered by a **fine-tuned EfficientNetV2-S deep learning model**.
This project demonstrates the end-to-end process of **computer vision inference**, from image input to real-time prediction, deployed as a public web app.

🔗 **Live Demo:**

## ✨ Features

* Upload a cat image **from local file**
* Paste an **image URL** for instant prediction
* Predict **Top-3 cat breeds** with confidence scores
* Clean, modern, and user-friendly UI
* Deployed publicly using **Streamlit Community Cloud**

---

## 🧠 Model Overview

* **Architecture:** EfficientNetV2-S
* **Framework:** PyTorch
* **Technique:** Transfer Learning & Fine-Tuning
* **Task:** Multi-class image classification (cat breeds)
* **Output:** Top-3 predicted breeds with probabilities

The trained model is hosted externally on **Hugging Face Hub** and automatically downloaded when the app runs.

## 🖼️ How It Works

1. User uploads an image or pastes an image URL
2. Image is preprocessed (resize, normalization)
3. Image is passed through the EfficientNetV2-S model
4. The app displays the **Top-3 most likely cat breeds**
